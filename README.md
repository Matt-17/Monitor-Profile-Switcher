# Monitor-Profile-Switcher
My fork of https://sourceforge.net/projects/monitorswitcher by Martin Kr√§mer

## Summary

Save monitor configurations of Windows 7 or 10 and easily switch 
between them with a click in a popup menu of your taskbar.

The tool is designed for users with two or more monitors who in certain
situations would like to quickly change their monitor setup (e.g. enable/disable 
a TV which is attached to the HDMI port, make an attached TV the primary 
display to remove tearing switch which monitor is on the left/right...). 
Along the monitor state and setup the resolution is also saved and restored.

The program works by saving a current monitor setup as configured using the 
windows control panel to an xml file. Once saved the configuration can be 
quickly restored at any time. Requires .NET 4.8 Framework to be installed.

The program is quite simple and in an early development stage. It is provided 
without any warranty. If you accidentally disable all your monitors boot into 
safe mode to fix the problem.

## Features

- Quickly change monitor configurations
